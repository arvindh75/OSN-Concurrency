-> Threads are created for each vaccination zone, each student and each company.
-> Storing info about each student, zone and company in global arrays.
-> Each zone and company has a separate lock.
-> Companies produce random number of vaccines and random number of batches when all the vaccines 
   they distributed got used up, infinitely until all students either test successful for antibodies
   or undergo 3 trails.
-> They busy wait for all the batches they produced to get used up.
-> A student enters the waiting queue to join a zone infinitely unless he tests positive for antibodies or 
   undergoes 3 trails. He is sent back home after 3 unsuccessful trials. He is sent to college if he has one
   successful trial.
-> waitzone() function tries to allocate a zone for all students in the waiting queue. It loops through the zones
   and allocates the first "Currently not in vaccination phase" and "Has atleast one slot left" zone. It busy waits
   until the allocated zone for a student completes vaccination phase and then tests for antibodies.
-> zone() function loops infinitely through all the companies looking for a vaccine batch to procure. When, it procures,
   it allocates random number of slots based on the condition given in pdf using assign_slot() function.
-> assign_slot() function assigns slots for a zone's one vaccination phase and try to assign students to the empty slots.
   Busy wait till all slots are used up and return back to zone() function to get re-called until all vaccines are over.
   After the slot is allocated for the last vaccine, it returns to zone() function and continues it search for batches to
   procure from by looping through all companies.
-> The zone enters "Vaccination Phase" in assign_slot() after the slots are assigned.
-> All of the infinite loops run only till all students exit.
NOTE: Waiting "queue" is not a queue, just used for convenience.
